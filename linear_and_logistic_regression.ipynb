        "\n",
        "A colleague in the materials testing laboratory has been conducting tensile tests on a low-carbon steel alloy. During a tensile test, a specimen is stretched until it breaks, and the applied force and resulting elongation are measured. These measurements allow us to determine the stress-strain relationship of the material.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What are stress and strain?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Stress is the force per unit area applied to a material, measured in Pascals (Pa) or megapascals (MPa). When you pull on a metal bar, the stress tells us how much force is distributed across its cross-section.\n",
        "\n",
        "Strain is the relative deformation of the material - how much it stretches compared to its original length. If a 100 mm bar stretches to 105 mm, the strain is 0.05 or five percent. Strain is dimensionless since it is a ratio of lengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Elastic versus plastic deformation**\n",
        "\n",
        "When stress is low, materials deform elastically. This means they behave like a spring - remove the load and they return to their original shape. The relationship between stress and strain in this region is linear, following Hooke's law where stress equals Young's modulus times strain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond a certain stress level called the yield strength, materials begin to deform plastically. Plastic deformation is permanent - the material does not return to its original shape when unloaded. In this region, the stress continues to increase with strain, but the relationship is no longer linear. The material work-hardens as dislocations in its crystal structure multiply and interact.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eventually, the specimen begins to neck - forming a localized region of reduced cross-section. After necking begins, the engineering stress (force divided by original area) actually decreases even though the true stress in the necked region continues to increase until fracture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your colleague has collected data from 150 measurement points during a single tensile test. However, they also recorded various material properties and testing conditions. They have shared this data with you to help analyze which factors most strongly influence the stress-strain behavior. The challenge is to determine which material parameters are important for predicting stress and which provide little useful information.\n",

Variance can be thought of as how much spread there is in the data along a particular direction.\n",

As we go from three dimensions to two dimensions, we omit PC3 (not shown in the image), which is a vector orthogonal to both PC1 and PC2. As we can see, removing PC3 does not significantly impact the shape of the data cloud because PC3 represents the direction in which the data varies the least. In proper terms, we say that PC3 has the lowest explained variance."

        "## Combining machine learning with materials science\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this notebook, we have explored how machine learning tools like PCA and linear regression can help analyze materials data. However, the most powerful approach combines these mathematical tools with domain knowledge from materials science.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key lessons:\n",
        "\n",
        "First, feature selection should be guided by physical principles. We know from metallurgy that carbon content, grain size, temperature, and strain rate all influence mechanical properties through well-understood mechanisms. Features like the Hall-Petch relationship (strength proportional to inverse square root of grain size) are not arbitrary - they emerge from the physics of dislocation motion in crystals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, model choice matters. A simple linear model can capture the elastic region of stress-strain behavior, but fails to represent plastic deformation and necking. However, by using polynomial features of strain (strain², strain³, strain⁴), we can capture the nonlinear work-hardening and necking behavior with linear regression. This approach is called polynomial regression, which is still linear regression because the coefficients appear linearly, even though the features themselves are nonlinear functions of strain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, machine learning helps us discover patterns in complex data, but domain knowledge helps us interpret whether those patterns are meaningful or spurious. The polynomial strain features are physically meaningful because they mathematically represent the nonlinear constitutive behavior of materials under plastic deformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the interactive demo below, you can select different material parameters and see how well linear regression captures their relationship to stress. Try selecting just strain first to see the linear fit, then add strain_squared and strain_cubed to capture the nonlinear behavior. Pay attention to how the R² value improves dramatically when you include polynomial terms."

In real engineering applications, materials experience multi-axial stress states - stress acting in multiple directions simultaneously. Your goal is to develop a model that can predict whether a material will yield (permanently deform) under these conditions.\n",

Under complex loading with multiple stress components, we need a way to combine these stresses into a single value that we can compare to the material's yield strength.\n",

Now, why is $J(\\theta)$ defined this way? Let's take a look at the log components plotted below. If $y=1$ (left plot) then the cost for this data point will be close to zero if the sigmoid is indeed close to 1. And sigmoid will approach a value close to one if the decision boundary $h_{\\theta}(x_0, x_1)$ returns a positive value. In this situation the decision boundary predicts correctly the value $y=1$. If the opposite happens, that is, $h_{\\theta}(x_0, x_1)$ is negative then the sigmoid value will be negative. In turn, the cost increases sharply. Similar reasoning follows for the case when $y=0$."

        "### What We Learned\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this exploration of linear and logistic regression applied to materials science, several key insights emerge.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the logistic regression successfully learned an approximation of the von Mises failure criterion from experimental data alone. The learned boundary closely matches the theoretical von Mises ellipse, validating both our experimental data and the machine learning approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, the model discovered the quadratic relationship. By including polynomial features, the model could learn that failure depends on squared stress terms and their interaction, matching the von Mises formula.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, physics-informed features improve learning. For both linear and logistic regression, including features based on our understanding of material mechanics helped the models learn the true relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fourth, the probability output from logistic regression provides valuable uncertainty information. Unlike a hard threshold, logistic regression gives us failure probabilities, which is useful for safety factors in design.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Engineering Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "These approaches are used extensively in real engineering contexts. Design optimization allows engineers to quickly evaluate if a design will fail under complex loading without running expensive physical tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Safety analysis benefits from the probability output, which helps engineers apply appropriate safety factors based on the consequences of failure. Material testing becomes more efficient because we can reduce the number of expensive tests by learning from existing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Key Lesson\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important takeaway is that machine learning is most powerful when combined with domain knowledge. We used our understanding of material mechanics to choose appropriate features, select suitable model architectures, interpret results in the context of physical laws, and validate predictions against theoretical expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This synergy between data-driven methods and physical understanding represents the future of engineering analysis. Machine learning provides the tools to extract patterns from complex data, while materials science provides the framework to ensure those patterns are physically meaningful and generalizable."
